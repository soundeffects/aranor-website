      <p>The beginnings of Aranor go back to the early days of Chronicles of Elyriaâ€™s inception.
      The founders had a simple dream of creating a metalsmithing guild, but the early kingdoms did not last.
      Over time the group grew into a county and then duchy. When Aranor became a kingdom it moved to the
      NA-W server to start fresh. The founders saw first-hand the damage that is done when a kingdom creates
      a very small elite that shuts out all other voices and disallows representation.</p>,

      <p>Aranor was constructed in such a way as to guard against that outcome. The Queen created a High
      Council composed of specialists in different policy areas that she would delegate her authority to and
      give them equal votes of advisory power. A system of rigorous selection was implemented to appoint
      these positions based on merit before all other considerations. This council is made up of commoners
      as well as nobles, but is expressly closed to Dukes. Dukes have their own Ducal Council that provides
      that separately advises the Queen and votes on proposed laws and policies. The greater populace of
      the kingdom also has access to the Senate, a forum where they can speak directly to all levels of the
      kingdom about substantive issues in plain view of all members.</p>,

      <p>Aranor also believes in the right of local governments with ability and merit to rule independently
      under the Queen, and for members to own their own businesses that operate in open markets, but that
      all Aranolts have rights guaranteed by the kingdom in a Bill of Rights that is publically posted and
      applies to commoners and nobles alike. These laws are enforced by local and high courts to ensure fair
      treatment of members and fair contract and business dealings.</p>,


      <h2>Aenean ut nisl et neque vulputate facilisis ac vitae odio.</h2>,

      <p>As a part of this attitude of freedom of expression and open discussion, Aranor has allowed its
      members to say what they feel, intervening only when truly inappropriate to others. This has given the
      kingdom an image of uncouthness in some circles. If this is the price of honesty and free speech, then it
      is with pride that Aranor will stand up and speak truth to power to defend its members against baseless
      accusations and lies. This is far better than becoming a despotic power that suppresses all dissent and
      falls into stagnation.</p>,

      <p>Aranor seeks peace and commerce with its neighbors, but will be prepared to strike against any that
      provoke it with a strong, well-organized, and well-trained military. While Aranor may not always agree
      with how other kingdoms conduct themselves it still believes that good relations and friendship is
      possible with any kingdom regardless of the past.</p>,

      <p>While Chronicles of Elyria has always been the focus of Aranor, it also seeks to be a community of
      gamers with events like game nights and hosting game servers for ourselves along with other kingdoms for
      other games while we wait for Chronicles of Elyria to be released. While we are known for joking and
      elbowing amongst ourselves we are united when it comes to our purpose of establishing a kingdom that
      allows opportunity and a voice for all. We welcome everyone to visit us and join us if Aranor is what you
      seek.</p>
